This is for completing an Udacity Reinforcement Learning project.

The instruction for running the code is provided below.
The code is written in Python 3 and PyTorch.

The goal of this project is to train an agent to pick up only yellow bananas (there are also blue bananas) in an Unity evironment.

1. The state and action spaces, and when the environment is considered solved:
2. Instructions for installing dependencies or downloading needed files:
3. How to run the code in the repository, to train the agent
